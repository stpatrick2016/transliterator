# Transliterator
> **NOTE**: The project is archived and is available for historical purposes only, since Windows now has "transliterated" native keyboards, this app is no longer needed.

The goal of the utility was to allow writing in Russian using only English keyboard. In general can be extended to any language although it has never been tested.

It works by capturing keystrokes and comparing them with map read from mapping file. If match found - the keystrokes are replaced with different characters.
